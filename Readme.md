.NET Standard extensions.

Made to never reinvent the wheel and to keep simple things as simple and zen as possible.

Little code pearls, a part of what makes CodeDog special.

## Modules

### Naming convention

Namespaces extending .NET Framework features are named similar, but with "Ex" suffix.
There are good reasons for it: related features need related names but
any part of the userspace namespace CANNOT match any part of Microsoft framework namespace
or the name resolution in the project will break.

## Usage

Either nuget, or copy the cs files if single exe is necessary.
